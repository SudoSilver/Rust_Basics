This is an repository where I explain rust how it makes sense to me

I am not the best rust programmer but I know my way around it and to help myself
and aspiring Rustaceans I am making this mess.

I will include some really basic boilerplate in the future but for now 
it has really basic concepts like
1. variables
2. basic math operations
3. if conditions

Check Rust by example at https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-by-example
it goes in way more depth than I am

if you are a seasoned Rustacean feel free to contribute 
judge me for my basic and overly specific code
reccommend improvements
or even make your own examples
